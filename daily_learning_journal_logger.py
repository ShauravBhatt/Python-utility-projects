Build a Python script that allows you to maintain a daily learning journal. Each entry will be saved into a `.txt` file along with a timestamp. 
                                                                                                                                                
Your program should:                                                                                                                            
1. Ask the user what they learned today.                                                                                                        
2. Add the entry to a file called `learning_journal.txt`.                                                                                       
3. Each entry should include the date and time it was written.                                                                                  
4. The journal should **append** new entries rather than overwrite.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                
Bonus:                                                                                                                                          
- Add an rating (1-5) for how productive the day was.                                                                                  
- Show a confirmation message after saving the entry.                                                                                           
- Make sure the format is clean and easy to read when opening the file.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                
Example:
